    "We can use Snell's Law and simple geometry to calculate the path of a ray through a layered earth model, from source to receiver. One approach is to \"shoot\" rays of one type (direct, multiple, etc.) from the source at different angles and see where they end up reaching the surface. We could guess and check angles manually until we find the right distance to the reciever. The computer does the ray-shooting calculation fast enough that we might as well calculate the distance for a range of angles all at once, then select the angle with the closest result.\n",
